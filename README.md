MHacks
======

36 hours of hacking in the world largest hackthon.

The main idea is helping hackers to join a team. Somehow, as one of two-member team, we challenge ourselves by using django to bulid a web app. None of us used it before. After 24 hours working, the basic framework is done. We even spend some time polishing it and design a logo.

For the analysis part, using matching algorithm discovered by Jack Edmonds is a choice. Due to the time limitation, we do not have time to combine those two parts. We could also give different weights based on the experience, and calculate the euclidean distance after normalization. Another one which is more accurate should be based on statitics. Researching a survey on the hackers who join Mhacks, then based on their rating, we could give a more reasonable weight. Then the lonely hacker could find teammates.



While most of the hackers choose to work with the language and technic theay are proficient, I really cherish these 30 hours. I learn something new, do some exciting stuff and have tons of fun.




Carpe Diem!
