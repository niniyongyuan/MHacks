MHacks
======

36 hours of hacking in the world largest hackthon.

The main idea is helping hachers to join a team. Somehow, as one of two-member team, we challage ourselves by using django. None of us used it before. After 24 hours working, the basic framework is here. We even spend some time polishing it and design a logo.

For the analysis part, using matching algorithm discovered by Jack Edmonds is a choice. Due to the time limitation, we do not have time to combine those two parts. We could also give different weights based on the experience, and calculate the euclidean distance after normalization. The one which is more accurate is based on statitics. Researching a survey on the hackers who joined Mhack is a good idea, then based on their rating, we could give a more reasonable weight. The the lonely hacker could find their teammates.




Carpe Diem!
